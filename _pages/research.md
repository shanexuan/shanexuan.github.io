I use field experiments, survey experiments, and quantitative text analysis to understand democratic erosion and democratic consolidation, with a regional focus on Southeast and East Asia. My dissertation studies (i) the source of democratic attitudes in developing countries, as well as (ii) determinants that safeguard democracy in the age of electoral authoritarianism.

## Curbing Clientelism in Local Elections: Evidence from the Philippines (w/ Nico Ravanilla and Ron Mendoza) [[pre-analysis](http://egap.org/content/clientelism-policy-based-campaigns-philippines); preprint]   

We measure the effect of an anti-vote buying intervention on vote buying incidents and electoral outcomes in the context of 2019 Philippine local elections. Through a field experiment with 1,541 party elites during the 2019 Philippine local elections, we find that the anti-vote buying intervention increases political competition at the local level. We identify two mechanisms that determine effectiveness of the anti-vote buying campaign, namely the *takeup cost*, and whether the intervention is *common knowledge*. When the intervention is common knowledge, it increases candidates' effort to mobilize voters. However, when the intervention is too costly for the candidates to take up, it can unintentionally *increase* candidates' effort in vote buying.  

## How Voters Perceive Democratic Backsliding in Developing Democracies [pre-analysis; preprint]

How do ordinary citizens perceive various instances related to democratic backsliding? We propose a methodology to measure democratic backsliding at the micro-level. Through a conjoint experiment and automated text analysis, we investigate how citizens in a developing democracy define democratic backsliding, as well as the situations under which people do not tolerate instances of democratic erosion. The paper sheds light on the mechanisms of *how* voters understand democracies erosion.
