Welcome! I am a Jerri-Ann and Gary E. Jacobs Fellow of social science at the University of California, San Diego, and a Ph.D. student in the UCSD political science department. My C.V. is available [here](../files/xuan-cv2019.pdf "cv"){:target="_blank"} (updated in May 2019). I study political economy and development, with a focus on China and the Philippines.  

I received an undergraduate dual degree magna cum laude in Mathematics and Political Science from Wabash College (IN) in May 2016. I am holding or have previously held research and teaching positions at UC San Diego (CA), Northwestern University (IL), and Wabash College (IN).
