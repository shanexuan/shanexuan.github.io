Welcome! I am a Jerri-Ann and Gary E. Jacobs Endowed Fellow at the University of California, San Diego, and a Ph.D. candidate in the UCSD political science department. I study political economy and development, with a focus on China and the Philippines. My C.V. is available [here](../files/xuan-cv2020.pdf "cv"){:target="_blank"}.  

I have held research and teaching positions at UC San Diego (CA), Northwestern University (IL), and Wabash College (IN). I received an M.A. in Political Science from UC San Diego (2019), and an A.B. in Political Science and Mathematics from Wabash College (2016). 

I am with Facebook [Civic Integrity](https://about.fb.com/actions/preparing-for-elections-on-facebook/) in 2020, and Facebook [Core Data Science](https://research.fb.com/teams/core-data-science/) in 2021.
