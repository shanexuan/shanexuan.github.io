The course is the _first_ code intensive class that students encounter in the MIA/MPP program. It introduces the theory and application of linear models for policy analysis. Students learn the underlying mathematical formalism, basic data management and coding skills, and appropriate interpretation and presentation of the econometric results. My most recent teaching evaluation is [here](https://shanexuan.github.io/files/qm2-eval-wi18.pdf).
