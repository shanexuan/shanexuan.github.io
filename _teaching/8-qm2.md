(with Francisco Garfias and Jen Burney) The course is the _first_ code intensive class that students encounter in the MIA/MPP program. It introduces linear models for policy analysis using Stata and R. My most recent teaching evaluation is [here](https://shanexuan.github.io/files/qm2-eval-wi19.pdf).
