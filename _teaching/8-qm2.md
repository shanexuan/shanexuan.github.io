(with Francisco Garfias and Jen Burney) The course is the _first_ code intensive class that students encounter in the MIA/MPP program. It introduces linear models for policy analysis using Stata and R. My most recent teaching evaluation is [here](https://shanexuan.github.io/files/qm2-eval-wi18.pdf). 

__IMPORTANT__: If you are in my lab, please bookmark the following [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F5tciuW92cYoFBdOK6K8iF3StXAlTdj3yvYe44Wmx0Q/edit?usp=sharing), as we will post lab agenda and Q&A in this document throughout the quarter.  If you want to make suggestions to improve the lab, please use the following [link](https://goo.gl/forms/JLL7ErnN0zWa6ewX2).
